    #Find the average of this model during the 10 runs (training and test set)
    #--> add your Python code here

    #Print the average accuracy of this model during the 10 runs (training and test set).
    #Your output should be something like that: final accuracy when training on contact_lens_training_1.csv: 0.2
    #--> add your Python code here
